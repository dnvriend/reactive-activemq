/**
 * This is a naive implementation of a bidirectional flow from/to ActiveMq using request-response; it assumes:
 * - that a 1 on 1 correspondence (bijection) exists between elements sent to - and received from the BACK-END
 * - that ordering is preserved between Out and In (see diagram); i.e. no mapAsyncUnordered, no foreachParallel,
 * ideally no network-traversals; careful with dispatching to actors, etc. If this property cannot be upheld due to
 * some stream-element's processing failing in an unexpected way, one will have to fail the graph
 * - that at-least-once-delivery is acceptable on the response-destination
 *
 * This flow is practical for the typical use case of handling a request received from activemq, processing it with
 * some bidi-flow, and dispatching a response to ActiveMq. The original requests gets acked once the response is sent.
